description: Overview of jump configuration files, CLI commands, and environment variables.
---

jump works out of the box with no configuration. Everything is customizable through three config files in `~/.config/jump/`:

| File | Purpose | Reference |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `host.toml` | Daemon behavior: listen address, port, Tailscale/relay remote access | [host.toml →](/reference/host-toml/) |
| `settings.jsonc` | Terminal options, keybinds, UI preferences | [settings.jsonc →](/reference/settings/) |
| `theme.jsonc` | Terminal color palette (Windows Terminal theme compatible) | [theme.jsonc →](/reference/theme/) |

All files are optional. Create or edit them manually. The only exception is `jumpd remote`, which can add `[tailscale]` to `host.toml` with your confirmation.

Settings and theme changes take effect on browser refresh (no daemon restart needed). Host config changes require restarting jumpd.
