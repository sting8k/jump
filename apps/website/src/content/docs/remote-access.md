title: Remote Access
description: Access jump from your phone, tablet, or another machine over Tailscale.

:::caution[Not a collaboration tool]
Remote access is for accessing **your own machine** from your other devices. It is not intended for sharing sessions with other people. Every connected user gets full, unrestricted shell access. See [Security](/security) for the full threat model.
:::

By default, jump only listens on localhost. To access it from another device, you can enable the built-in [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) listener. Tailscale creates an encrypted private network between your devices without opening ports or configuring firewalls.

## Setup

The fastest path: run `jumpd remote` and follow the prompts. It handles configuration, walks you through Tailscale registration, and verifies the result. You can run it again at any time to check the status.

The steps below cover the same process in detail.

### 1. Set up Tailscale

If you haven't used Tailscale before:

1. [Create an account](https://login.tailscale.com/start) (free for personal use, up to 100 devices).
2. [Install Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) on the machine running jump **and** on the device you want to connect from.
3. Sign in on both devices with the same account.

If you already use Tailscale, just make sure both devices are on the same tailnet.

### 2. Enable HTTPS and MagicDNS

In the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns):

1. Enable **MagicDNS** so devices can find each other by name.
2. Enable **HTTPS Certificates** so Tailscale can issue valid TLS certificates for `*.ts.net` hostnames.

Both are required. You can verify they're enabled by running `jumpd remote` after setup.

### 3. Enable and register

```bash
jumpd remote
```

This walks you through the process interactively: it explains what remote access does, asks for confirmation, enables Tailscale in `~/.config/jump/host.toml`, restarts the daemon, and waits for Tailscale to connect.

On first setup, Tailscale needs you to log in:

```
Enable remote access? [y/N] y

Enabled tailscale in /home/user/.config/jump/host.toml
Restarting daemon...
jumpd: running (pid 12345)
  Logs: /home/user/.local/state/jump/jumpd.log

Connecting to Tailscale...

To complete setup, log in to Tailscale:
  https://login.tailscale.com/a/...

After logging in, run `jumpd remote` again to check the connection.
```

Visit the URL to approve the device. jump registers as its own device in your tailnet, separate from the machine's Tailscale. After login, run `jumpd remote` again:

```
$ jumpd remote
Connecting to Tailscale...
  local:  http://127.0.0.1:8790
  remote: https://jump.your-tailnet.ts.net

Remote access is active.
```

You can also edit `host.toml` manually instead:

```toml
[tailscale]
enabled = true
```

See [host.toml reference](/reference/host-toml/) for all fields (hostname, allow list).

:::note[Multiple machines]
Each machine on the same tailnet needs a unique hostname. Set it in `host.toml`:

```toml
[tailscale]
enabled = true
hostname = "jump-desktop"
```

This gives you `https://jump-desktop.your-tailnet.ts.net`.
:::

### 4. Connect

On your other device, open `https://jump.your-tailnet.ts.net`. The connection is HTTPS with a valid certificate.

:::note
The Tailscale listener is independent from the localhost listener. Local access (`127.0.0.1:8790`) always works, so you can't lock yourself out by misconfiguring Tailscale.
:::

## Sharing access

Every connection is verified by Tailscale's cryptographic identity and checked against an allow list. Your primary account is allowed automatically. See [Security](/security) for the full verification design.

### Adding your other accounts

If you use multiple Tailscale accounts (e.g. personal and work), add them to the allow list so you can connect from either:

```toml
[tailscale]
enabled = true
allow = ["your-work-account@github"]
```

Then restart: `jumpd restart`.

If the other account is on a **different tailnet**, you also need to share the jump device via the [Machines](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) page (⋯ → Share). The device is then accessible at `jump.owner-tailnet.ts.net` (using the owner's tailnet name).

## Experimental outbound relay

> This is for restrictive networks where the machine running jump can make outbound HTTPS/WebSocket connections but cannot accept inbound connections. It is not needed for the normal Tailscale flow above.

Run a relay server on a VPS:

`jump-relayd` ships in the official release archives alongside `jump` and `jumpd`.

```bash
jump-relayd -listen :8791 -token '<strong-random-token>'
```

Terminate TLS with Caddy/nginx and proxy your public HTTPS origin to this listener; configure jumpd with the resulting `wss://.../_jump/agent` URL.

Put the same token and the relay WebSocket URL in `~/.config/jump/host.toml` on the machine running jump:

```toml
[relay]
enabled = true
url = "wss://jump.example.com/_jump/agent"
token = "<strong-random-token>"
```

Then restart jumpd:

```bash
jumpd restart
```

Browsers connect to the relay's public HTTPS origin. jump's normal auth token/cookie flow still applies; the relay token only authenticates the jumpd agent to the relay.


## Troubleshooting

Run `jumpd remote` to diagnose most issues. It checks whether the daemon is running, whether the device is registered, and whether HTTPS and MagicDNS are enabled.

**`ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` in the browser**: the device isn't registered, or MagicDNS is disabled. Run `jumpd remote` to check.

**jump doesn't appear in the Tailscale dashboard**: jump registers as its own device, not through the machine's Tailscale. Check the daemon log for the login URL: `cat $(jumpd log-path) | grep tsauth`. You can also run `jumpd run` in foreground mode to see the URL directly.

**Certificate warning**: HTTPS certificates aren't enabled in your tailnet. Enable them in your [Tailscale DNS settings](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns), then restart jumpd.

**Certificate error when accessing a shared machine**: Tailscale issues certificates for the **active tailnet DNS name** only. If the owner renamed their tailnet after issuing certificates, the guest may see a mismatch. Check that the active name in [DNS settings](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) matches what `jumpd remote` shows.

**Can't reach from a specific device**: make sure Tailscale is installed, signed in, and connected on that device.
