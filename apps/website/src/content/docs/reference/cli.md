## jump

The session runner and primary entry point. Auto-starts jumpd if needed.

`jump` has no subcommands. Flags before the command apply to jump itself; once the first positional argument is seen, everything after it is the command to run, verbatim, including its own flags. Use `--` to disambiguate when the command starts with a dash.

### `jump`

Open the jump UI in a browser. Starts jumpd if it is not already running. Prefers Chrome/Chromium in `--app` mode for a standalone window; falls back to the default browser.

### `jump [--no-attach] <command> [args...]`

Run a command inside a jump session. The session registers with jumpd and appears in the web UI.

```bash
jump bash
jump python3 main.py
jump pi "build the feature"
jump --no-attach pytest --watch       # detach from the terminal
jump -- --my-dash-cmd                 # `--` preserves a dashy command
```

Which behavior `jump <cmd>` exhibits depends on whether stdin is a terminal and whether you're already inside a jump session:

| Stdin              | Inside `JUMP=1`? | Behavior                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TTY                | no               | Attach: wire your terminal to the child PTY, forward Ctrl-C and resize, detach when the terminal closes. |
| TTY                | yes              | Auto-detach: spawn the session in the background and return immediately, so PTYs don't nest.            |
| Pipe / file / null | either           | Block, stream bounded metadata to stdout, exit with the child's exit code. The session keeps running for the UI to attach to. |

The pipe / file / null row is the canonical shape for scripts and agent harnesses: you get a blocking call, bounded stdout (no full PTY noise leaks into your script's logs), and reliable exit-code propagation. `--no-attach` forces the auto-detach behavior even from a terminal.

See [Scripts and agents](/integrations/scripts-and-agents/) for the narrative version, including a worked build-and-report example.

### `jump --list` (`-l`)

List known sessions, alive first, newest first.

```
$ jump --list
ID        STATUS  KIND   TITLE
a3f20187  alive   pi     fix auth bug  (/home/mg/dev/myapp)
be14b052  alive   shell  bash          (/home/mg/dev/jump)
7d3304e9  dead    shell  make build    (/home/mg/dev/myapp)
```

The ID column shows the 8-character short form the web UI uses; most management flags accept unique ID prefixes, the full session ID, or the session's slug.

### `jump --attach <id>` (`-a`)

Reattach your local terminal to an existing session. The session's scrollback is replayed on connect, SIGWINCH is forwarded, and closing the terminal detaches without killing the session — identical to how `jump <cmd>` itself behaves.

```bash
jump --attach a3f20187
jump -a fix-auth-bug        # slug also works
```

Attach requires an interactive terminal. Remote peer sessions are supported transparently — jumpd proxies the WebSocket to the owning node.

### `jump --tail <N> <id>` (`-t`)

Print the last `N` lines of a session's output as plain text (scrollback plus the currently visible screen, ANSI stripped). Useful for peeking at a background session without attaching to it.

```bash
jump --tail 100 a3f20187
jump -t 20 fix-auth-bug
```

`--tail` currently only works for sessions owned by the local node; remote peer sessions are rejected with a clear error.

### `jump --kill <id>` (`-k`)

Terminate a running session. Sends the same signal chain the UI's kill button does: `SIGTERM` to the child, normal exit lifecycle, session marked dead.

```bash
jump --kill a3f20187
```

### `jump --send [--no-submit] <id> [text]`

Inject input into a running session, as if the bytes had been typed at the terminal, and submit it. By default `--send` appends a carriage return after the payload so the agent or shell processes it as a complete line; `--no-submit` suppresses that for the rare flow where you want to pre-fill the input box without dispatching it.

```bash
jump --send a3f20187 'describe yourself'           # submits
jump --send a3f20187 < prompt.txt                  # submits stdin
echo 'describe yourself' | jump --send a3f20187    # equivalent
printf '\x03' | jump --send --no-submit a3f20187   # send Ctrl-C without an extra Enter
jump --send --no-submit a3f20187 'draft '          # leave "draft " in the input box
```

When `text` is omitted, jump reads from stdin until EOF and sends whatever it sees (capped at 1 MiB). Stdin mode is the natural shape for piping multi-line input from files or heredocs.

**Access control.** `--send` is powerful — anything you send lands in the session's PTY, and the child has no way to distinguish it from keyboard input. Access is gated by filesystem permissions on the session's Unix socket (owner-only, `0700`), which means only the user that started the session can send to it. Other users on the same machine cannot connect to the socket at all. For the same reason, `--send` is local-only: cross-machine sending would need an explicit authorization model that doesn't exist yet.

### `jump --wait [--timeout N] <id>`

Block until the agent in the session has finished its turn. Returns 0 when the agent reaches an idle state (the spinner stops), 2 if the session dies before becoming idle, and 3 if the optional `--timeout` elapses first.

```bash
jump --send a3f20187 < prompt.txt
jump --wait a3f20187
jump --tail 50 a3f20187 > result.log
```

The idle signal is the same `Status.Working` flag the UI's spinner consumes: each agent adapter (claude, codex, pi) flips it false once its agent has emitted its final message for the turn. Wait returns immediately if the agent is already idle when called (so composition with `--send` is reliable when the agent races ahead between the two CLI hops).

Shell sessions don't emit an idle signal and are rejected with a clear error rather than returning a misleading idle. To wait for a shell command to finish, run it directly via the piped flow above or compose with `timeout`.

Local sessions only; remote peer sessions are rejected until peer subscriptions stream `Status` events back to the hub.

## jumpd

The daemon. Manages sessions, serves the web UI, and optionally provides Tailscale remote access.

### `jumpd start`

Start the daemon in the background. If an existing instance is running, it is stopped first (the old version is printed for confirmation). Logs to `~/.local/state/jump/jumpd.log`. Prints the PID on success.

```
$ jumpd start
jumpd: stopping existing daemon (1.0.0)...
jumpd: running (pid 12345)
  Logs: /home/user/.local/state/jump/jumpd.log
```

Reads [`host.toml`](/reference/host-toml/) for configuration. Binds to `listen` + `port` (default `127.0.0.1:8790`) and creates a Unix socket for local IPC. Use `listen = "0.0.0.0"` or `JUMPD_LISTEN=0.0.0.0` for LAN/VPN/container access.

### `jumpd run`

Run the daemon in the foreground. Same as `start`, but blocks until interrupted. Use this for systemd services, Docker containers, or debugging.

### `jumpd restart`

Alias for `start`. Stops any running instance and starts a fresh one.

### `jumpd stop`

Stop the running daemon via the Unix socket.

### `jumpd status`

Show daemon health, session counts, and peer status.

```
jumpd 1.0.0 (ready)
  tcp:    127.0.0.1:8790
  socket: /home/user/.local/state/jump/jumpd.sock
  remote: https://jump.tailnet.ts.net

Sessions: 3 alive (2 local, 1 remote), 12 dead (15 total)

Peers:
  • desktop (1 session)
    https://jump-desktop.tailnet.ts.net
  ○ jump-server (offline)
    https://jump-server.tailnet.ts.net
  ✗ manual-peer (connection refused)
    https://peer.example.com
```

### `jumpd auth`

Show the TCP listen address, auth token, and a ready-to-open login URL. Useful for connecting from another device on the local network.

```
Listen:     127.0.0.1:8790
Auth token: abc123...

Open this URL to authenticate:
  http://127.0.0.1:8790/auth/login?token=abc123...
```

### `jumpd remote`

Set up or check Tailscale remote access.

If Tailscale is not yet configured, explains what remote access is, asks for confirmation, enables it in `host.toml`, restarts the daemon, and waits for Tailscale to connect. The command guides you through the entire process interactively.

If already enabled, polls the daemon until Tailscale reaches a known state, then shows the connection status. It only reports HTTPS/MagicDNS problems after confirming the connection is established, so you never see false warnings from a daemon that is still starting.

See [Remote Access](/remote-access/) for the full guide.

### `jumpd log-path`

Print the daemon log file path with no extra output, suitable for scripting.

```bash
tail -f $(jumpd log-path)
cat $(jumpd log-path) | grep tsauth
```

### `jumpd version`

Print the version string.

### `jumpd help`

Show the usage summary.
